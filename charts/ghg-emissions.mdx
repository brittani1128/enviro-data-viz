Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which cause climate change have increased 50 fold since the mid-1800s. Energy makes up nearly three-quarters of global emissions, followed by agriculture. Breaking down the energy sector into its sub-sectors, electricity and heat generation make up the largest portion of emissions, followed by transportation and manufacturing. 64% of GHG emissions come from just 10 countries, while the 100 least-emitting contributed less than 3%.
