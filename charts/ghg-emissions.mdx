Greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and flourinated gases, are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and make the planet warmer, thus causing climate change. GHG emissions have increased 50 fold since the mid-1800s, almost entirely due to human activity.

Energy makes up nearly three-quarters of global emissions, and is the direct result of burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for electricity, heat, and transportation. In 2018, transportation was the largest source of US greenhouse gas emissions at about 28%, closely followed by electricity at 27% of total emissions. The majority of emissions from transportation are from passenger cars and trucks.
You can make a difference to consume less energy by moderating your thermostat, using energy efficient lighbulbs, washing your clothes in cold water and line dry if possible, and choosing energy efficient appliances. Walk, ride your bike, or take public transportation to reduce passenger car use, and consider an electric vehicle or hybrid option.

Agriculture makes up about 10% of GHG emissions. Livestock such as cows produce CH4, while certain agricultural soils can lead to increased nitrogen in the soil, resulting in N2O emissions.

Land use and forestry results in GHG emissions through the exchange of CO2, as well as CH4 and N2O, between the atmosphere and the plants and soils on land. Plants, soils, and dead organic matter absorb CO2 from the air, but as forests are cleared, or lands cultivated for crops, this change in land use results in the exchange of gases. The US overall since 1990 has resulted in more removal of CO2 from the atmosphere than emissions through proper land use management, however globally this is not the case.

The Industry sector produces the goods and raw materials we use everyday. GHG emissions are produced by burning fossil fuels, through chemical reactions during the production of chemicals, iron and steel, and cement, and from leaks from industrial processes or equipment.
Some ways you can help reduce emissions from industry include buying more energy efficient products, such as lightbulbs and appliances, or buy recyled products which don't require the consumption of raw materials.
