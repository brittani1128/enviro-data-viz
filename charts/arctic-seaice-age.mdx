## About the Figure

- This chart shows the distribution of Arctic sea ice area by age group during the week in September with the lowest ice coverage for the year.
- Using daily satellite images, wind measurements, and data from surface bouys that move with the ice, scientists are able to track specific parcels of ice as they move over time, and calculate the age of the ice.

## Background

- Sea ice is an integral part of the Arctic Ocean. During the winter months the ice essentially covers the entire ocean, while in summer the warmer temperatures melt some of the ice. The minimum thickness and coverage of ice is usually reached in mid September.
- The area covered by Arctic sea ice is an important indicator of changes in global climate because warmer air and water temperatures are reducing the amount of sea ice present.
- Sea ice age is also an important indicator of Arctic conditions because ice that has accumulated over many years is typically stronger and thicker than younger ice. The loss of older ice suggests that Arctic ice cover is thinning.
- There is also evidence that the melt season has become longer: ice is starting to melt earlier in the year and freeze later.

## Why Does This Matter?

- Changes in sea ice can directly affect Arctic ecosystems, and particularly mammals like polar bears and walruses that rely on the sea ice for hunting, breeding, and migrating.
- The reduced sea ice coverage and thickness restricts access to food, and many of these animals face declining birth rates along with starvation.
- The loss of ice and wildlife has also impacted the traditional subsistence hunting lifestyle of indigenous Arctic populations, such as the Inuit.
